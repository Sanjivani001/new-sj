                    Once upon a time, in a land far away, there lived a wealthy merchant with his three children. The two older daughters were vain and cared only about beauty and riches, while the youngest, Beauty, was humble, kind, and gentle. She was admired for her beauty, but what made her truly special was her loving heart and inner goodness.
    <br>
    <br>

    One day, the merchant lost his fortune. A series of misfortunes had struck—storms sank his ships, and he was left with nothing but a small cottage in the countryside. Life became much harder for the family, but they adjusted, learning to live with less. The merchant tried to sell his goods to restore some of his wealth, and when he had earned a small sum, he set out on a journey to the city.
    <br>
    <br>

    Before he left, the merchant asked his daughters what they would like him to bring back. The older sisters asked for expensive dresses and jewelry, but Beauty, who needed nothing, simply asked for a single rose. The merchant promised to bring her one, and he went on his way.
    <br>
    <br>

    On his return journey, the merchant got lost in a dark, dense forest. After wandering for hours, he discovered a magnificent castle, the grandest he had ever seen. Though no one was around, the doors opened to him, and he entered, seeking shelter from the storm.
    <br>
    <br>

    The castle was beautifully decorated, and the merchant was treated with kindness, offered a luxurious meal, and given a comfortable bed to sleep in. The next morning, as he prepared to leave, the merchant noticed a beautiful rose garden. He thought of his daughter, Beauty, and plucked a single rose to bring back to her.
    <br>
    <br>

    No sooner had he picked the rose than a deep, rumbling voice called out from behind him. "Who dares take my rose?" The merchant turned and saw a terrifying creature—a Beast, with the body of a man but the face and features of a monster. The Beast's eyes glowed with fury.
    <br>
    <br>

    The merchant, trembling with fear, explained that he had picked the rose for his daughter, Beauty, who had asked for one. The Beast, furious, said, "Because you have taken what is mine, you must pay the price. You have two choices: you will die for stealing my rose, or you will send one of your daughters to take your place."
    <br>
    <br>

    The merchant begged for mercy, and after a long pause, the Beast gave him a final chance. "Return to your home and bring one of your daughters. If she agrees to stay, you may go free. But if she does not return within a set time, I will come for you."
    <br>
    <br>

    With a heavy heart, the merchant agreed and returned to his cottage. He explained to his daughters what had happened and asked them to choose who would go in his place. His two older daughters, terrified, refused, but Beauty, filled with compassion for her father, offered to go.
    <br>
    <br>

    "Do not worry, Father," she said. "I will go in your place, for I do not want you to suffer because of me."
    <br>
    <br>

    So, Beauty left with the merchant to face the Beast. When they arrived at the castle, Beauty was struck by its grandeur. Though it was dark and filled with mystery, the Beast greeted her with kindness. He led her to a magnificent room, filled with elegant furniture and beautiful things.
    <br>
    <br>

    Though she was frightened by the Beast’s appearance, Beauty soon realized that he was not cruel. Every night, the Beast would ask her the same question: "Will you marry me?" But Beauty, though she was grateful for his kindness, would gently refuse each time.
    <br>
    <br>

    Instead, she spent her days exploring the vast and magical castle. There were enchanted objects, talking mirrors, and strange wonders that filled her with awe. Despite the Beast’s appearance, she began to see that beneath his monstrous exterior, he was gentle and lonely, longing for companionship.
    <br>
    <br>

    One day, the Beast, noticing how much Beauty missed her family, offered her a magical mirror that could show her anything she wished to see. Beauty, longing to see her father, asked the mirror to show him. She saw that he was ill and in great need of her care.
    <br>
    <br>

    Beauty, deeply worried, begged the Beast to allow her to visit her father, promising that she would return. The Beast, though heartbroken at the thought of losing her, agreed, but warned her that she must return within a week, or there would be terrible consequences.

    Beauty returned to her family, where her sisters pretended to be delighted to see her. However, they were secretly jealous of the comfort she enjoyed at the Beast’s castle and persuaded her to stay longer than she had promised. Though Beauty was reluctant, she remained, wanting to care for her father and not suspecting how long she had been gone.
    <br>
    <br>

    But as the days passed, she began to feel guilty. She remembered her promise to the Beast and the warning he had given her. When she finally decided to return to the castle, she hurried back, fearing that she might have broken her word.
    <br>
    <br>

    To her dismay, when Beauty arrived at the castle, she found the Beast lying on the ground, gravely ill. He had been heartbroken by her absence and had nearly given up on life. The sight of him in such a state filled her with sorrow, and she rushed to his side, promising that she would never leave him again.
    <br>
    <br>

    In that moment, as tears filled her eyes, Beauty spoke from the heart, "I love you, Beast. I see now that I love you more than anything, and your appearance no longer matters to me. I love you for who you are inside."
    <br>
    <br>

    As soon as she spoke those words, the magic of the castle worked in a wondrous way. The Beast’s monstrous form faded, and in his place stood a handsome prince. He smiled, and the curse that had transformed him was broken.
    <br>
    <br>

    The prince explained that he had once been a handsome ruler, but he had been cursed by a wicked fairy for his arrogance and selfishness. The curse could only be broken by someone who loved him despite his appearance, and Beauty had shown him that kind of love.
    <br>
    <br>

    The prince and Beauty were married in a grand ceremony, and the entire kingdom rejoiced. Beauty’s family was invited, and they were amazed by the transformation of the Beast and the love between him and Beauty.
    <br>
    <br>

    And so, Beauty and the Prince lived happily ever after. Together, they ruled the kingdom with kindness and wisdom, and their love grew stronger each day.
