                              Once upon a time, in a beautiful kingdom, there lived a kind and gentle young girl named Cinderella. Her father was a wealthy merchant, and they lived happily together in a grand house. However, when Cinderella's mother passed away, her father remarried a woman who had two daughters of her own. These stepsisters were selfish, rude, and envious of Cinderella’s beauty and kindness. They treated her terribly, forcing her to do all the household chores while they enjoyed a life of luxury and leisure.

Cinderella’s father, although kind-hearted, traveled often on business and was unaware of how cruelly his daughter was treated. Over time, her life became even harder. She had to sleep by the fireplace in the kitchen, covered in ashes and soot, which is how she got the name “Cinderella.”<br><br>

One day, news arrived that the king was hosting a grand ball at the palace. The ball was to find a bride for his son, the prince. Every young woman in the kingdom was invited to attend, and Cinderella’s stepsisters were excited. They spent days preparing, choosing the finest dresses and accessories, while Cinderella, of course, had nothing to wear. She wanted desperately to go, but her stepmother told her it was impossible.<br><br>
"You’re too dirty to go to the ball, and you don’t have a dress," her stepmother said. She locked Cinderella in the attic and forced her to do more chores while they left for the ball.

Cinderella was heartbroken. She sat by the fireplace, crying, when suddenly, a light appeared before her. It was her fairy godmother! The fairy godmother had heard Cinderella’s wishes and had come to help her.

"Don’t worry, my dear," said the fairy godmother, waving her wand. "I will make your dreams come true."<br><br>

With a flick of her magic wand, the fairy godmother transformed Cinderella’s tattered clothes into a beautiful ballgown made of the finest silk. She turned Cinderella’s worn shoes into sparkling glass slippers. But there was one condition: "You must leave the ball before midnight, for that is when the magic will fade."

Cinderella thanked her fairy godmother and promised to return before the magic wore off. She then entered a grand pumpkin from the garden, which the fairy godmother turned into a magnificent carriage. The mice who lived in the house were transformed into horses, and a rat was turned into a coachman to drive the carriage.

When Cinderella arrived at the ball, everyone gasped at her beauty, especially the prince. He asked her to dance, and they danced together all evening. Cinderella was overjoyed, for it had been her dream to attend a ball like this, and now her dream had come true. The prince, enchanted by her grace, could not take his eyes off her. <br><br>

Cinderella and the prince danced under the sparkling chandeliers, lost in the music and each other's company. They spoke little, but their eyes conveyed all the words they needed. Cinderella felt like she was in a dream, as if everything she had ever wished for had come to life in that moment.

However, as the clock struck midnight, a sudden chill ran through her. She remembered the warning her fairy godmother had given her: the magic would wear off at the stroke of midnight. Panic flooded her heart as she pulled away from the prince. <br><br>

“I must go!” she whispered, her voice trembling. <br><br>

Before he could respond, she fled from the ballroom, her glass slippers leaving delicate imprints on the grand staircase. The prince, realizing what was happening, hurried after her, but she had vanished into the night, leaving only a faint trail of shimmering light.

Cinderella’s magnificent carriage had returned to its humble pumpkin form, and the mice had turned back into their original shape. She found herself standing in the garden, breathless and disoriented, in the same rags she had worn earlier. But one thing remained — the delicate glass slipper that had slipped off her foot in her hurried escape.

The next day, the prince searched the kingdom for the mysterious girl who had captured his heart. He carried the glass slipper with him, determined to find the one it belonged to. He visited every home, asking each young woman to try on the slipper, but it did not fit anyone.

When he arrived at Cinderella’s house, her stepsisters eagerly tried on the slipper, but it was clear it was not meant for them. Then Cinderella stepped forward, her heart pounding with anticipation. When the slipper slid perfectly onto her foot, the prince’s face lit up with recognition and joy.

“Cinderella!” he exclaimed, taking her hand. “It’s you! I knew it was you.” <br><br>

Tears of happiness filled Cinderella’s eyes. The prince knelt before her, and with a smile, asked, “Will you marry me?” <br><br>

Cinderella, overwhelmed with emotion, nodded. “Yes, I will.”<br><br>

The prince and Cinderella were married in a grand ceremony, surrounded by the joy of their families and friends. Cinderella’s kindness, grace, and courage had led her to her happily ever after, and she lived a life filled with love and happiness alongside the prince, forever cherished as the one who brought magic to his heart. <br><br>
